# 🚗 Car Price Prediction Project

This repository contains a project focused on **predicting car prices** using machine learning techniques.  
The goal is to explore data, build predictive models, and evaluate their performance in estimating vehicle prices.

## 📂 Project Overview
- **Data preparation**: data cleaning and standartization 
- **Exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to understand relationships and trends  
- **Model training and evaluation** using regression algorithms  
- **Performance comparison** across multiple models
