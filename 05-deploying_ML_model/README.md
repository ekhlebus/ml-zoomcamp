This repository contains info about saving, loading, and deployment churn prediction model.

Our model is still in Jupyter notebook. Now let's deploy it - save it and use it.

“Deploy the model” means taking a trained machine-learning model and making it available for real-world use, so that new data can be sent to it and it can return predictions.

This usually involves putting the model into a production environment—such as a web service, API, cloud platform, or application—so that users or other systems can call it to get predictions.
